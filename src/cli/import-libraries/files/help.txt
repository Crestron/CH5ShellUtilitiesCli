Usage:
    ch5-shell-cli import:components [options]
    
You could also use `yarn` or `npm run` to import components. The following are the commands:
    yarn import:library [options]
    npm run import:library [options]

Options:
    -h, --help,         Help for Importing libraries from the './app/project/libraries/' folder
    -z, --zipFile,      Prefix for full location path of the zip file to be imported
    -l, --list,         Prefix for list of file names
    -f, --force         Force the program to overwrite the target files with the source files and avoid any confirmation
    --all,              Select this option to import all the files

You could use `ch5-shell-cli` to import the complete contents of the zip file to './app/project/libraries/' folder (replace {path} with the location of the exported zip file):
    yarn import:library -z {path} --all

You could also use `yarn` or `npm run` to import library. The following are the commands:
    yarn import:library -z {path} --all
    npm run import:library -- -z {path} --all

You could use shortcut script `imp:l` with yarn and npm commands as the following:
    yarn imp:l
    npm run imp:l

Import selected libraries from './app/project/libraries/' folder. In this case, the filenames are mandatory in the command prompt. The filename must follow the complete path starting from './app/project/libraries/....'. Only filenames can be provided here (no folder paths). Multiple file names can be provided in the command prompt. To achieve this, use the following commands:
    yarn import:library -z ./dist/exported-library.zip -l ./app/project/libraries/a.js ./app/project/libraries/b.js
    npm run import:library -- -z ./dist/exported-library.zip -l ./app/project/libraries/a.js ./app/project/libraries/b.js
    yarn import:library -z ./dist/exported-library.zip --list ./app/project/libraries/a.js ./app/project/libraries/b.js
    npm run import:library -- -z ./dist/exported-library.zip --list ./app/project/libraries/a.js ./app/project/libraries/b.js
    yarn imp:l -z ./dist/exported-library.zip -l ./app/project/libraries/a.js ./app/project/libraries/b.js
    npm run imp:l -- -z ./dist/exported-library.zip -l ./app/project/libraries/a.js ./app/project/libraries/b.js
