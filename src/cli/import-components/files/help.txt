You could use `ch5-shell-cli` to import the complete contents of the zip file to './app/project/components/' folder.

- ch5-shell-cli import:components -z {path} --all

- yarn import:components -z {path} --all
- npm run import:components -- -z {path} --all

You could use shortcut script `imp:c` with yarn and npm commands as the following:

Import selected components from './app/project/components/' folder. In this case, the filenames are mandatory in the command prompt. The filename must follow the complete path starting from './app/project/components/....'. Only file names can be provided here (no folder paths). Multiple file names can be provided in the command prompt. To achieve this, use the following commands:
    yarn import:components -z ./dist/exported-components.zip -l ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    npm run import:components -- -z ./dist/exported-components.zip -l ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    yarn import:components -z ./dist/exported-components.zip --list ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    npm run import:components -- -z ./dist/exported-components.zip --list ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    yarn imp:c -z ./dist/exported-components.zip -l ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    npm run imp:c -- -z ./dist/exported-components.zip -l ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
