Usage: 
    ch5-shell-cli export:assets [options]

You could also use `yarn` or `npm run` to export assets. The following are the commands:
    yarn export:assets [options]
    npm run export:assets [options]

Options:
    -h, --help,         Help for exporting assets from the './app/project/assets/' folder
    -l, --list,         Prefix for list of asset file names
    --all               Select this option to export all the asset files

Export the complete assets directory from './app/project/assets/' folder. To achieve this, use the below commands:
    ch5-shell-cli export:assets --all

You could also use `yarn` or `npm run` to export assets. The following are the commands:
    yarn export:assets --all
    npm run export:assets -- --all
    yarn exp:a --all
    npm run exp:a -- --all

You could use shortcut script `exp:a` with yarn and npm commands as the following:
    yarn exp:a
    npm run exp:a

Export selected assets from './app/project/assets/' folder. In this case, the file names are mandatory in the command-prompt. The filename must follow the complete path starting from './app/project/assets/....'. Only file names can be provided here (no folder paths). Multiple file names can be provided in the command-prompt. To achieve this, use the below commands:
    yarn export:assets -l ./app/project/assets/data/translation/en.json ./app/project/assets/scss/_variables.scss
    npm run export:assets -- -l ./app/project/assets/data/translation/en.json ./app/project/assets/scss/_variables.scss
    yarn export:assets --list ./app/project/assets/data/translation/en.json ./app/project/assets/scss/_variables.scss
    npm run export:assets -- --list ./app/project/assets/data/translation/en.json ./app/project/assets/scss/_variables.scss
    yarn exp:a -l ./app/project/assets/data/translation/en.json ./app/project/assets/scss/_variables.scss
    npm run exp:a -- -l ./app/project/assets/data/translation/en.json ./app/project/assets/scss/_variables.scss
