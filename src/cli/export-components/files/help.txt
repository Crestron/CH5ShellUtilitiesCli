    ch5-shell-cli export:components -l ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    ch5-shell-cli export:components --list ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html
    ch5-shell-cli exp:c -l ./app/project/components/pages/page1/page1.html ./app/project/components/widgets/pagedisplay/pagedisplay.html

You could also use `yarn` or `npm run` to export components. The following are the commands:
