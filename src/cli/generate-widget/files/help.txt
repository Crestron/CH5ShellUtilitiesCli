The widget name is mandatory to create a widget. It must start with a letter and can contain letters, hyphens, spaces, underscores, and numbers.

If the widget name is not provided in the 'generate:widget' command, or if the widget name is incorrect, the developer will be prompted to enter a widget name, and a default value for the widget name will be displayed. This widget name will be set with the following rules:
    • Sets the name of widget as 'WidgetX', where 'X' is an incremental number.
    • If 'WidgetX' already exists, then X is incremented by 1.

Examples:
• For a list of existing widgets (Widget1, Widget2, Widget04, Widget3), the new prompted widget name would be Widget4.
• For a list of existing widgets (Widget1, Widget2, Widget6, Widget7), the new prompted widget name would be Widget3.

The developer can accept the default widget name, or can change the default widget name as needed. The default is widget name is displayed as a placeholder in the terminal window. Some additional features to modify default widget name are as follows:
• Click the 'Tab' key to make changes to this value.
• Click the 'Enter' key to accept the widget name.
• Start typing on the placeholder to create a custom widget name.

Based on the input for widget name, the following will be the generated widgets and file or folder names:

| No | Input Widget Name    | Generated Widget Name     | Generated File and Folder Names |
