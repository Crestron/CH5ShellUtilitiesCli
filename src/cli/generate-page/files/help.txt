The Page Name is mandatory to create a page. It must start with a letter and can contain letters, hyphens, spaces, underscores and numbers.

If page name is not provided in the 'generate:page' command, or if the page name is incorrect, the developer will be prompted to enter a page name, and a default value for the page name will be displayed. This page name will be defaulted with the below business rules:
    • Set the name of page as 'PageX', where 'X' is an incremental number.
    • If 'PageX' already exists, then X is incremented by 1.

Examples:
 • List of existing pages: Page1, Page2, Page04, Page3. New prompted page name is Page4
 • List of existing pages: Page1, Page2, Page6, Page7. New prompted page name is Page3

The developer can accept the default page name, or can change the default page name as needed. The default is page name is displayed as a placeholder in the terminal window. Some additional features to modify default page name are:
• Click the 'Tab' key to make changes to this value.
• Click the 'Enter' key to accept the page name.
• Start typing on the placeholder to create a custom page name.

Based on the input for page name, the following will be the generated pages and file or folder names:

| No  | Input Page Name | Generated Page Name | Generated File and Folder Names |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 01  | LEDLights       | ledlights           | ledlights                       |
| 02  | ledlights       | ledlights           | ledlights                       |
| 03  | LEDLIGHTS       | ledlights           | ledlights                       |
| 04  | LED-Lights      | ledLights           | led-lights                      |
| 05  | LED_Lights      | ledLights           | led-lights                      |
