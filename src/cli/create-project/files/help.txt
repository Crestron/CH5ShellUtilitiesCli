    
Use `ch5-shell-cli` to create a new project. The following are the command(s):
    ch5-shell-cli create:project [options]

There are two ways to create a project using CLI. 

a. Passing a configuration JSON file: This file is similar to project-config.json. The project can be created with customized content like 'selectedTheme', newer pages and widgets, etc.. The user will not be prompted for any further information, and all details will be picked from the json file.

`ch5-shell-cli create:project --config ./downloads/sample-config.json`

b. Passing the name of the project:

`ch5-shell-cli create:project --projectName "my-new-shell-template"`

Since the configuration json file is not provided, all content information will be selected from a default config file available internally in the CLI project. 

If the projectName argument is not provided, then the user will be prompted to add a project name. 

Validation for projectName argument are as follows:
    - project name length should be greater than zero and cannot exceed 214
    - project name characters must be lowercase i.e., no uppercase or mixed case names are allowed
    - project name can consist of hyphens, tilde, numbers and alphabets
    - project name can consist of underscore and dot but these cannot start with these characters
    - project name should not end with a dot
    - project name must not contain any non-url-safe characters (since name ends up being part of a URL)
    - project name should not contain any spaces or any of the following characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = [ { } ] | \ : ; " ' < , > ? /

Other inputs that can be passed are: 
    --projectType
    --forceDeviceXPanel

Validation for other arguments (these are optional and need not be added for creating a project) are as follows:
    - projectType: must be either shell-template or ZoomRoomControl. Default value is 'shell-template' if either projectType is not provided or is invalid.
    - forceDeviceXPanel: must be either Y or N or true or false. Default value is false, if either forceDeviceXPanel is not provided or is invalid. If projectType is ZoomRoomControl, then the value of forceDeviceXPanel is always set to true. 

If config file is added as an argument along with other parameters to the create:project command, then config file takes precedence, and other parameters are ignored.
